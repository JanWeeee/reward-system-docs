# Getting Started

Welcome to the PerkVenue API documentation. In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to get started with the PerkVenue API and build your own loyalty program.

Prerequisites:

A PerkVenue account
Basic knowledge of REST APIs
Authentication credentials
Step 1: Authentication
The first step is to authenticate with the PerkVenue API using your API Key. To authenticate your API requests, you must include your API Key as a bearer token in the Authorization header of each request.

let a = 1;

console.log(a);
```
